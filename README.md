## How can I file a Privacy Rule Complaint

If you believe that a HIPAA-covered entity or its business associate violated your (or someone elseâ€™s) health information privacy rights or committed another violation of the Privacy, Security, or Breach Notification Rules, you may file a complaint with the Office for Civil Rights (OCR). OCR can investigate complaints against covered entities (health plans, health care clearinghouses, or health care providers that conduct certain transactions electronically) and their business associates.
