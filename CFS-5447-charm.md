I am the President of Fasten Health, Inc. a Personal Health Record (PHR) application that allows patients to create a longitudinal health record using Patient Access APIs.

I’m submitting an Information Blocking Complaint against:

- **Name:** Charm Health
- **Website:** https://www.charmhealth.com
- **Role:** Certified Health IT
- **CHPL Link:** https://chpl.healthit.gov/#/listing/9741

I’ve attempted to register with their development environment, and have experienced a number of issues making it impossible.

Timeline:

- Feb 2024 - Initial communication with Charm. 
- Was informed that they charge fees for sandbox access and a separate fee for each health system that Fasten Health would connect to. 
- Was informed that Charm would not provide Fasten Health access, and instead each Health System would need to request and grant access to Fasten independently. 
- Aug 12, 2024 - Followup email, no response

I've attached our email thread below.
