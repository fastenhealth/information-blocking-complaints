I am the President of Fasten Health, Inc. a Personal Health Record (PHR) application that allows patients to create a longitudinal health record using Patient Access APIs.

I’m submitting an Information Blocking Complaint against:

- **Name:** Cyfluent  
- **Website:** https://www.cyfluentphr.com/
- **Role:** Certified Health IT  
- **CHPL Link:**  https://chpl.healthit.gov/#/listing/10072

I’ve attempted to register with their development environment, and have experienced a number of issues making it impossible.

- They will not provide a list of FHIR Endpoints and organization details as required in [45 CFR 170.404(b)(2)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/subtitle-A/subchapter-D/part-170#p-170.404(b)(1))
- They require patients to request Fasten from clinics/health systems, who will then forward requests to Cyfluent *before* development can begin.


Timeline:

- Feb 5, 2024 - initial outreach and conversation
- Feb 6, 2024 - discussion where Cyfluent incorrectly classified Fasten as a Data Broker
- Feb 12, 2024 - follow up, no response
- Feb 22, 2024 - follow up, no response
- April 24, 2024 - follow up, response with questions directed towards Drummond Group
